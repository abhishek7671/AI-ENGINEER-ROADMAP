PYTHON:

What to learn:
    syntax and data types: integers, strings, lists, dictionaries.
    Flow Control: if-else, loops.
    Functions and modules
    OOPS:classes, objects
    File I/O (reading/writing files)
    Virtual environments and package managers(pip, venv)

why?
    All modern AI tools and implemented in python (with libraries like SCIKIT-LEARN, PYTORCH, TENSORFLOW)

MATHEMATICS FOR AI:


What to learn?
    Linear Algebra: Vectors, dot product, matrices, eigenvalues.
    Probability: events, conditional probability, distributions.
    Statistics: mean, variance, standard deviation, hypothesis testing.
    Calculus: derivatives and gradients(just enough for understanding optimization)


why?
    Math help you understand why models work, tune them and interpret the results

For Example?
    Gradient: for backpropagation
    Vectors/matrices: for representing data and parameters.
    probability: for understanding uncertainty and loss Functions.

DATA SKILLS:

What to learn?
    Reading/writing CSV and JSON
    Data Cleaning: Missing values, outliers
    Feature Engineering: Encoding categoriacal data, scaling features.
    Visualization: Histograms, scatterplots, boxplots


why?
    Real-worlddata is messy: Understanding and cleaning it is 80%  the job


Best Resources?
    Pandas -- freecodecamp
    Data Analysis with Python

MACHINE LEARNING (ML)

What to learn?
    What is supervised and unsupervised learning?
    Dataset Splits: Training / validation / test
    Evaluation Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC.
    Bias-variance trade-off and overfitting


why?
    without these, you can't judge model proformance or fix problems


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ML ALGORITHMS:
    Regression: Linear and logistic
    Classification: Decision trees, Random forest, svm
    Clustering: k-means, DBSCAN
    Dimensionality reduction: PCA

Why?
    These algorthims from the toolkit for solving most problems
